      <p class="lede">
        Litia builds neural pathways in students learning to read by utilizing iOS devices' TrueDepth camera to analyze
        what a user reads and pairing sight with letters, phonemes, words, and numbers linked to an image and audio cue. Put simply,
        Litia reads to users as they read.

    <h2>How the experience works</h2>
    <p>
      Quizzes use eye tracking on iOS devices to identify the letter, phoneme, or word a learner looks at.
      The app highlights the item, displays an associated image, and speaks the word before the learner selects
      the matching term for the prompt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Story mode reads along with the learner while they track text on screen, and the vocabulary pathway uses
      gaze-guided flashcards to build rapid recognition across languages.
