        Litia is an iOS learning app that uses the TrueDepth camera for real-time gaze interaction and
        text-to-speech — processed entirely on device. It supports early readers, new language learners,
        and accessibility use cases across English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese.

    <h2>How the experience works</h2>
    <p>
      Quizzes use eye tracking on iOS devices to identify the letter, phoneme, or word a learner looks at.
      The app highlights the item, displays an associated image, and speaks the word before the learner selects
      the matching term for the prompt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Story mode reads along with the learner while they track text on screen, and the vocabulary pathway uses
      gaze-guided flashcards to build rapid recognition across languages.
