<Layout title="Privacy Policy — Litia">
  <h1 class="pageTitle">Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="subtle">Last Updated: January 18, 2026</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Litia is an educational application designed for children, families, and educators. We are committed to
      protecting user privacy and complying with applicable privacy laws, including COPPA (United States), GDPR
      (European Union), and the UK GDPR / Children’s Code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Litia is designed to function offline by default. Unless explicitly stated in this policy, Litia does not
      transmit personal information to our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Litia collects minimal information to function:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning progress and app state (e.g., completed activities, proficiency progress, streaks, settings, in-app currency balance).</li>
      <li>Visual preferences (e.g., avatar selection, button theme selection).</li>
      <li>Optional, non-identifying diagnostic information stored locally for troubleshooting (if enabled by an adult).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not require users to provide a real name, phone number, address, or any other personally identifying
      information to use the core experience.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Camera and Eye Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      Litia may request access to the device camera for real-time eye tracking. Camera data is processed on-device
      only for the purpose of detecting gaze direction and enabling hands-free learning interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not store, save, or transmit camera frames, face images, or video recordings for eye tracking. Camera data
      is used transiently in memory and discarded immediately after processing.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Audio and Text-to-Speech</h2>
    <p>
      Litia uses iOS text-to-speech to read educational content aloud. Litia does not record or transmit user speech.
      If microphone permissions are ever requested in a future version, this policy will be updated and the app will
      clearly explain why it is needed.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy (COPPA / UK Children’s Code)</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No advertising identifiers are used.</li>
      <li>No behavioral tracking or third-party ad SDKs are used.</li>
      <li>We do not sell personal information.</li>
      <li>Data is stored on the device and can be deleted by removing the app or resetting its data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you believe Litia has collected a child’s personal information unintentionally, contact us and we will work
      with you to delete any data we can access. In offline mode, data is stored locally on the device and can be
      deleted directly by the device owner.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell, rent, or share personal information with third parties for advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may share information only if required by law, to protect the safety of users, or to enforce legal rights.
      Because Litia is offline by default, we generally do not possess server-side user data to share.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      By default, Litia stores data locally on the device. This data is protected by iOS security features (such as
      the app sandbox and device-level protections).
    </p>
    <p>
      We use reasonable safeguards designed to reduce risk of unauthorized access. No method of storage is 100% secure;
      however, Litia is designed to minimize data collection and exposure by operating offline.
    </p>

    <h2>8. International Users (EU/UK)</h2>
    <p>For users in the EU/UK, the typical legal bases for processing are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Performance of a contract (providing the app’s functionality),</li>
      <li>Legitimate interests (improving the learning experience), and/or</li>
      <li>Consent (where required).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because Litia stores data on-device by default, international data transfers generally do not occur unless cloud
      services are enabled in a future version.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, delete, or restrict processing of personal information.</p>
    <p>In offline mode:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can delete data by deleting the app or resetting the app’s data (where available).</li>
      <li>If cloud features are added later, we will provide additional access/deletion tools and update this policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Litia uses Apple system frameworks (e.g., AVSpeechSynthesizer, camera APIs) to provide core functionality. We do
      not integrate third-party advertising SDKs. If we add third-party services (analytics, cloud sync, etc.) in the
      future, we will update this policy and provide appropriate disclosures and controls.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last Updated” date
      and, where appropriate, provide in-app notice.
    </p>
